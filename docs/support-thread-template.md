# Support: {{APP_NAME}} ({{SHORT_DESCRIPTOR}} for Unraid)

## What this is

{{APP_NAME}} is {{ONE_SENTENCE_APP_DESCRIPTION}}.

This AIO package exists to make {{UPSTREAM_APP_NAME}} easier to install and maintain on Unraid without forcing users to manually translate a multi-container setup, wire extra dependencies, or guess at first-boot defaults.

## Who this is for

- Beginners who want the easiest reliable Unraid install path
- Intermediate users who want a cleaner AIO baseline
- Power users who still want access to supported advanced settings

## Tradeoffs

- Updates to {{UPSTREAM_APP_NAME}} may lag while the AIO packaging is validated and rebuilt.
- Some advanced upstream configuration paths may not be exposed in the default Unraid template.
- This packaging may behave differently from the official multi-container deployment guide when the AIO wrapper chooses simpler defaults.
- You are relying on the AIO maintainer for packaging fixes, security patches, and catalog refreshes.

## Quick install notes

## Support scope

This thread covers the wgross19 Unraid AIO packaging for {{APP_NAME}}.

For support, please include:

- your Unraid version
- your container template settings that matter to the issue
- relevant container logs
- screenshots if the issue is UI-related
- what you expected to happen vs what actually happened

If the issue appears to be upstream behavior rather than the Unraid packaging layer, I may redirect you to the upstream project as appropriate.
